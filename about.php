        <li><p class="about">Underrepresented artist refers to a person who performs creative activities, and attempts to generate income by selling art pieces, but is not being represented or does not own a gallery.</p></li>
        <li><p class="about">The field of art is one of the many industries where there is a lack of diversity.  The <a href="https://www.arts.gov/" target="_blank">National Endowment for the Arts (NEA)</a> have released various reports on the demographics of the artists.  It was found out that women are not strongly represented in this field and that there are more white than non-white artists.  The NEA also released a research report showing that in the United States there are a total of 2.5 million artists which represent 1.8% of the total labor; 84% or 2.1 million were employed in primary jobs as artists, 12.5% or 0.315 million were employed in secondary jobs as artists, and 3.5% or 0.088 million were unemployed.</p></li>
        <li class="read-more-target"><p class="about">Moreover, there is a perception by the society that making art is frivolous or only recreational.  The societal contributions of artists are not well understood despite of its socioeconomic contributions.  However, in 2013, arts and cultural production contributed $704.2 billion to the U.S. economy, a 32.5 percent increase since 1998 <a href="https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/ACPSA_fact_sheet_feb2016.pdf" target="_blank">[1]</a>.   Also, artists represent a larger group than the legal profession (lawyers, judges, and paralegals), medical doctors (physicians, surgeons, and dentists), or agricultural workers (farmers, ranchers, foresters, and fishers) <a href="https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/ArtistsInWorkforce_ExecSum.pdf" target="_blank">[2]</a>.</p></li>
        <li class="read-more-target"><p class="about">Internationally, there is a significant number of underrepresented artists, but the percentages in terms of gender and race may vary.  It is imperative to provide a support structure for the artists in the US and across the world.</p></li>
        <li class="read-more-target"><p class="about">Imagine how the labor force will be strengthened should the artists be encouraged and enabled in their creative pursuits.  By consuming and experiencing art differently, these individuals are empowered and there will be impactful contributions on the socioeconomic growths of every country.</p></li>

        <li><p class="about">Showcased is a non-profit organization that aims to generate additional revenue streams for underrepresented visual artists, photographers, designers, and other artists by exhibiting and selling unique arts online. Another objective of the organization is to establish the online presence and branding of the underrepresented artists by leveraging on Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and developing a mobile application using Augmented Reality technology.</p></li>
        <li class="read-more-target"><p class="about">Without being able to showcase the artworks in onsite galleries, there is a limited market for arts, which makes the internet a significant channel to reach out to art collectors, enthusiasts, and people who are interested in purchasing art pieces.  Nevertheless, despite the various social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest, selling art online is challenging because there is no software built to address the concerns specific for this niche.  Showcased uses business analytics to understand what the buyersâ€™ preferences are.  This tool is also used when an artist is being submitted and presented to the gallery, museum, and store partners.  In addition to, Showcased has partnered with Amazon FBA to handle the logistics in delivering the item to the customer.  With its end to end solution, from Marketing to Logistics, the artist would be able to focus on its creative activities instead of worrying on how he could pay the bills while still pursuing his passions.</p></li>
